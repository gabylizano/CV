**Professional Experience**

**Amazon January 2021 -- December 2025**

**Program Manager II**

Led a Privacy and Security Program Team, and Special Projects focused on
closing or reducing gaps in HR processes related to employee\'s Personal
and Job Data Management. Analyzing each Project\'s individual impact and
its return of investment to help prioritizing the work.

-   Managed the Job and Personal Data Program as part of the Global
    Privacy and Security Team receiving and reviewing all projects,
    prioritizing, I managed to automatize Personal Data management
    related processes and reduce the need for manual support of 14 out
    of 20 processes via tickets up to 60%, during the first three
    quarters of 2025. This translated to a reduction in force while
    providing business continuity.

-   Coordinated the migration of a system used to store and manage all
    employee job and personal data. Analyzed data dictionaries and HR
    administrators' data usage to identify access and privacy
    requirements. Implemented a secure self-service model that
    restricted access to sensitive information while allowing employees
    to manage required personal data such as gender and religion. This
    approach strengthened data privacy controls and increased employee
    trust and satisfaction by ensuring their information was securely
    managed.

**IBM August 2016 -- January 2021 Software Transition Manager**

Led successful Software re-imaging, packaging and distribution projects
on the client side to agreed processes. Communicating processes,
timeframes and dependencies.

-   Led the development of a custom automation solution that eliminated
    the need for InstallShield licensing to run scripts on client
    software solutions. Replaced paid licenses with a script-based
    package built using ADT and Visual Basic, enabling execution across
    multiple client environments without third-party tools. The
    successful implementation reduced reliance on software packagers,
    eliminating 15 licenses, and generated an estimated cost savings and
    revenue impact of approximately \$170K.

-   Managed the Deskside Automation project by redesigning ServiceNow
    queue categorization to enable automated resolution based on issue
    type. Developed scripts that allowed packagers to deploy fixes to
    multiple clients simultaneously without direct machine access or
    user interaction. Solutions were automatically downloaded and
    executed based on the client's Office version, reducing the monthly
    ticket backlog from 300 to 10 and significantly improving
    operational efficiency.
